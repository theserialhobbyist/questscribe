## 🎮 What is QuestScribe?

QuestScribe is a desktop word processor built specifically for LitRPG authors. It lets you embed **state change markers** directly in your text to track character progression—levels, stats, items, skills—automatically calculating the current state at any point in your story.

**Never lose track of your character's HP mid-battle. Never forget which spells they've learned. Never wonder what's in their inventory.**

## 💾 Installation

### Download Pre-built Binaries

**Coming Soon!** Pre-built installers will be available from the [Releases](https://github.com/theserialhobbyist/questscribe/releases) page.

- **Windows**: `.exe` installer or `.msi` package
- **macOS**: `.dmg` disk image (Universal: Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: `.deb` (Ubuntu/Debian), `.AppImage` (universal)

### Build from Source

See [Building from Source](#-building) below.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js**: Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- **System Dependencies**:
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools with "Desktop development with C++"
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: See [PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md](PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md)

### Running the Development Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theserialhobbyist/questscribe.git
cd questscribe

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The first run takes several minutes to compile Rust dependencies. Subsequent runs are faster (~30 seconds).

### Using QuestScribe

1. **Create a character**: Click "Create New Character" in the sidebar
2. **Write your story**: Type in the main editor area
3. **Add state changes**: Click "✨ State Change" button or right-click in text
4. **Track progression**: Watch the sidebar update as you move your cursor
5. **Save your work**: Click "Save" to create a `.qsd` file

## 🔨 Building

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended) - GitHub Actions

Simply push a version tag to automatically build for all platforms:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

GitHub Actions will:
- ✅ Build for Windows, macOS, and Linux simultaneously
- ✅ Create installers for all platforms
- ✅ Create a GitHub Release with all artifacts

See [CICD_GUIDE.md](CICD_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Manual Local Build

To build locally on your current platform:

```bash
npm run build
npm run tauri build
```

**Output locations:**
- **Windows**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/*.exe`
- **macOS**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/*.dmg`
- **Linux**: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/*.deb` or `appimage/*.AppImage`

See [PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md](PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md) for platform-specific requirements.
